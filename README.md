# Project Ideas

## 1) Face Occlusion and Spoof Detection.

Detection of Occlusion (Covering on users face like mask, helmet, glasses etc) along with spoof detection (Facial spoof attack is a process in which a fraudulent user can subvert or attack a face recognition/ Detection system by masquerading as a legitimate user and thereby gaining illegitimate access and advantages.) to enhance security systems by saving the snapshot of uncovered spoof free face and timestamp of the user's access and retriving it in case of a complaint or missuse reporting. 		

## 2) Real Time server attack detection.
	
**Problem Statement**: Identify what factors are involved in suspicious sessions in a server and also build a classification model to predict an attack during a session.

**Abstract**: Network security is becoming increasingly relevant with the enormous growth of computer network use and the enormous increase in the number of applications running on top of it. All computer systems suffer from security flaws that are technically difficult to overcome by manufacturers and economically expensive.The position of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), as special purpose devices for detecting network anomalies and attacks, is therefore becoming increasingly important. For a long time, research in the intrusion detection area has concentrated mainly on anomaly-based and misuse-based detection techniques. While detection based on misuse is generally favored in commercial products because of its predictability and high precision, in academic research.Due to its theoretical potential for resolving novel attacks, anomaly detection is usually conceived as a more efficient tool. There is no evidence of using machine learning based anomaly detection methods when we look at the state of the art IDS solutions and commercial resources, and practitioners still claim that it is an immature technology. A lot of study was carried out in anomaly detection to find the explanation for this contrast and considered different factors such as learning and detection techniques, training data sets, data sets of testing, and methods of evaluation.

**Persona**: Enterprise companies that value their software and want to protect it in real-time.

## 3) Text based Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing. 

A large amount of data that is generated today is unstructured, which requires processing to generate insights. Some examples of unstructured data are news articles, posts on social media, and search history. Sentiment analysis is a NLP task, which involves classifying texts or parts of texts into sentiment and getting insights on that text data.  
   
   Possible Applications are:
* Review/ Comments Classification.
* Speech sentiment Analysis (Text based).
