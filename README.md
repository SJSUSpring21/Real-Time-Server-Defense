# Project Ideas

### 1) Face Occlusion and Spoof Detection.

Detection of Occlusion (Covering on users face like mask, helmet, glasses etc) along with spoof detection (Facial spoof attack is a process in which a fraudulent user can subvert or attack a face recognition/ Detection system by masquerading as a legitimate user and thereby gaining illegitimate access and advantages.) to enhance security systems by saving the snapshot of uncovered spoof free face and timestamp of the user's access and retriving it in case of a complaint or missuse reporting. 		
 
### 2) Real Time server attack detection.
	
Intro:
In today's world of software engineering, server logs are very helpful in viewing previous connections to servers.  However, with machine learning, these server logs can now be used to predict real-time server attacks. No longer do companies find out about an attack before it's too late.

Abstract:
Using a dataset of logs, we can create a model that predicts when a real server attack is happening. We can identify what factors are involved in suspicious sessions in a server log and building a classification model to predict an attack during a session.

Approach:
Using the columns like time and duration, source/destination IP address, network protocol, and packets used, we can build a classification model that will identify suspicious network usage and will be able to predict server anomalies.  

Persona:
Enterprise companies that value their software and want to protect it in real-time.

### 3) Text based Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing. 

A large amount of data that is generated today is unstructured, which requires processing to generate insights. Some examples of unstructured data are news articles, posts on social media, and search history. Sentiment analysis is a NLP task, which involves classifying texts or parts of texts into sentiment and getting insights on that text data.  
   
   Possible Applications are:
* Review/ Comments Classification.
* Speech sentiment Analysis (Text based).
