## 1) HR Analytics: Finding Quality Candidates 

**Problem Statement**: Find quality job candidates who are likely to stay long-term after hiring.    

**Abstract**: Hiring quality candidates isn't always easy.  An increasing trend in today's generation is to accept a job offer only to leave after a year or less.  Companies are then forced to find new candidates to hire and train, which could be expensive and time consuming.  We believe that machine learning can help companies find quality candidates who will stay long term.  Machine learning in the HR field is still very new and most companies still use teams of employees to make hiring decision.  However, these teams will be able to make improved decisions when paired with our software.        

**Approach**: To use a machine learning model to find quality long-term hires.  We will use factors like education level, major, experience, and previous company size to distinguish candidates from each other.   

**Persona**: Companies that struggle with retaining employees and want to improve their hiring system.

## 2) Real Time server attack detection.
	
**Problem Statement**: Identify what factors are involved in suspicious sessions in a server and also build a classification model to predict an attack during a session.

**Abstract**: Network security is becoming increasingly relevant with the enormous growth of computer network use and the enormous increase in the number of applications running on top of it. All computer systems suffer from security flaws that are technically difficult to overcome by manufacturers and economically expensive.The position of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs), as special purpose devices for detecting network anomalies and attacks, is therefore becoming increasingly important. For a long time, research in the intrusion detection area has concentrated mainly on anomaly-based and misuse-based detection techniques. While detection based on misuse is generally favored in commercial products because of its predictability and high precision, in academic research.Due to its theoretical potential for resolving novel attacks, anomaly detection is usually conceived as a more efficient tool. There is no evidence of using machine learning based anomaly detection methods when we look at the state of the art IDS solutions and commercial resources, and practitioners still claim that it is an immature technology.

**Approach**: To use a machine learning model to detect an ongoing attack by using factors like size of the data transferred in single connection, number of wrong fragments in the connection, number of failed logins and different time related traffic features. 

**Persona**: Enterprise companies that value their software and want to protect it in real-time.

## 3) Face Occlusion and Spoof Detection.

Detection of Occlusion (Covering on users face like mask, helmet, glasses etc) along with spoof detection (Facial spoof attack is a process in which a fraudulent user can subvert or attack a face recognition/ Detection system by masquerading as a legitimate user and thereby gaining illegitimate access and advantages.) to enhance security systems by saving the snapshot of uncovered spoof free face and timestamp of the user's access and retriving it in case of a complaint or missuse reporting.
